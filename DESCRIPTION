Description: This package perform weighted-pvalue based multiple hypothesis test 
    and provides corresponding information such as ranking probability, weight, 
    significant tests, etc . To conduct this testing procedure, the testing 
    method apply an empirical probabilistic relationship between the test rank by
    external covariates and the corresponding test effect size.
